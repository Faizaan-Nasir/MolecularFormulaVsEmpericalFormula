    <h1>Molecular Formula Versus Emperical Formula</h1>

    <h2>What we need to know in this module:</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>
            The meaning of <span class="special">molecular formula </span> is a chemical formula that gives the total
            number
            of atoms of each element in each molecule of a substance. We have brushed through this term a few times in
            the
            past and are pretty familiar with it by now. The sum of mass of all atoms in the molecule is known as the
            molecular mass of that compound.
        </p>
        <p>
            A formula giving the proportions of the elements present in a compound but not the actual numbers or
            arrangement of atoms is called the <span class="special">emperical formula</span>. This is a new term that
            we will learn in grade 11 (if you haven't already). A compound with molecular formula C6H12O6, the emperical
            formula would be the molecular formula divided by the LCM of all the number of atoms. Thus the emperical
            formula is CH2O. The mass of this formula is known as the emperical formula mass.
        </p>

    <h2>The purpose of this module:</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>
            Now that we know the meanings of the term, the fields in this module would begin making sense. You may enter
            the emperical formula in terms of Elements, and the respective number of atoms of that element in it's
            emperical formula. You must remember not to put the whole emperical formula in the same text block. Taking
            our example of CH2O, the number of atoms of Carbon is 1, you may now put the compound 'C' in the field E1
            and 1 in No. field following the E1 field. You may press the demo button to figure out how to fill the
            respective fields for our example CH2O.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that as of now, the webpage only works with the atomic masses of the first 20 elements: Hydrogen
            to Calcium.
            Any element that is entered into the fields below and has an atomic number more than 20 will cause the
            webpage to throw an error.
            Incase the compound only has 2 elements, leave the last two boxes of the emperical formula field empty.
        </p>
